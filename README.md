# Magic_materials
A mod providing shared resources for my other mods: [bweapons_modpack ](https://github.com/ClockGen/bweapons_modpack), [gadgets_modpack](https://github.com/ClockGen/gadgets_modpack) and possibly others.  

This mod is not very useful when used by itself, as it only provides a new set of tools, 2 new ores, some decorations and various craftitems (useless without mods mentioned above).

## Recommended mods:
- [bweapons_modpack ](https://github.com/ClockGen/bweapons_modpack)
- [gadgets_modpack](https://github.com/ClockGen/gadgets_modpack)
- [farming_redo](https://notabug.org/TenPlus1/farming) (registers a new hoe if farming is present)
